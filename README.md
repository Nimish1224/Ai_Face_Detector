# <em> AI Face Detection Algorithm </em>
## Working Principle
   <p><b>                  A facial recognition system identifies or verifies a person’s identity by analyzing their face. The raw input for the camera is the person’s face recorded in real-time. The AI-enabled face recognition system captures the person’s image from the recorded video, analyzes it and compares it with images stored in its database.
Facial recognition combined with a biometric fingerprint is useful for access control and prohibition of entry for unintended persons.</b></p>
## Requirements
The first step is to install OpenCV. Run the following command line in your terminal :

## Imports and models path
We’ll create a new Jupyter notebook / python file and start off with :
