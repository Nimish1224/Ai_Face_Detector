# Working Principle
A facial recognition system identifies or verifies a person’s identity by analyzing their face. The raw input for the camera is the person’s face recorded in real-time. The AI-enabled face recognition system captures the person’s image from the recorded video, analyzes it and compares it with images stored in its database.
Facial recognition combined with a biometric fingerprint is useful for access control and prohibition of entry for unintended persons.
